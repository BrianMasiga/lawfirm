should appear on the frame of every document uploaded. Individual Users should be able to add his / her own signature & stamp.

MOBILE BROWSER DETECTION

For making our brand successfull, We should also include an automatic "Mobile Browser Detection & Redirection" server-side script. We might also use this as User Agent Detection, where a server makes a decision on what to serve based on how an incoming browser describes its capabilities. We might also want to use this as an alternative or fallback method to the previous one Mobile Browser Detection in PHP. Other implementations feature real-time JavaScript requests to database like DeviceAtlas or WURFL that also supply information n what is not complete until its automatically triggered 
for every mobile user!

Copy and Paste this PHP Code:
Use this function to detect mobile handsets as set by the conditions above.

<?php
require_once('mobile_device_detect.php');
mobile_device_detect(true,false,true,true,true,true,true,false,false);
?>

Hi,

I just got a call that the law firm software should be completed and delivered by the end of this month.

How far have you gone? Please try and create an activity log menu / icon in the Admin area only so that he can track all users. I.e admin can track log per user.
 I don't want it to be displaying on the user profile so that it won't mess every page up.
 Users and admin should also have notification icon for MESSAGE, Notification just like facebook and on user wall, 
 user should be able to post something for one on one or for all just like facebook

----------------------------------------------------------------------------

No limit to file upload as court or case processes are always large.

File format allowed are .pdf, .docx, .doc, .ppt, .jpg, .png, .xls, .csv, 

File should have option to view within an iframe and also option to download.

Have you been able to sort the PDO connection issue? 

---------------------------------------------------------------------

Our fields will be Name, Department, Designation, Phone number and Amount which will be made available from the Data inputed by the ADMIN in the course of creating account for staff (Users).
